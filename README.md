Visual Studio Code ``` ctrl + shift + P ``` Flutter: New Project

Add dependencies to ``` pubsec.yaml ```

```
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2

  google_sign_in: ^5.3.3
```

Save in Visual Studio Code or run ``` flutter pub get ``` to update changes.

## Overwrite Files 

replace  ``` lib ``` and ``` assets ``` folders from repo.

change all ``` import 'package:<project name> ``` refrences in all files in folders
  - test
  - lib
  - assets


add to ``` pubsec.yaml ```
```   assets:
        - assets/
```

## Create and setup new Firebase project for Android

goto ``` https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ ```

select "Add Project"

enter new project name ( example: fluttertemplate ) and press "Create Project"

click "Android icon" to initilize Android setup.

locate package name at ``` android/app/build.grade ```  variable name applicationId ( example: ``` com.example.flutter_template ``` )

create app nickname

SHA-1 Certificate can be generated by opening terminal and navigating to ``` '<path>\Android Studio\jre\bin' ```

Enter command ``` keytool -list -v -keystore "C:\Users\<user>\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android ```

Follow the remaining instructions to update ``` build.gradle ``` files

inside ``` android/app/build.grade ``` change minSdkVersion to ``` minSdkVersion 19 ```

Goto Firebase home -> build -> authentication -> sign-in method and enable google signing.
